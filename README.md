# [GitLab 101 Tool Certification Notes + Important Sources](https://atulkamble.github.io/GitLab101/)


## About GitLab 101 training
This certification is for those who needs to know how to use GitLab and be technical to some level. This training is geared toward GitLab team members who are in non-engineering roles (i.e. recruiting, peopleops, marketing, finance, etc) and/or have not used a DevOps tool like GitLab before. This can also be helpful for non-engineering people outside of GitLab wanting to learn how to use GitLab for personal projects.

## Technical Terms

## GitLab
GitLab is a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git-repository manager providing wiki, issue-tracking and CI/CD pipeline features, using an open-source license.
Summarized: GitLab is a complete DevOps platform, delivered as a single application.

## Git
Definition: is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

## DevOps
Definition: is a set of practices that combines software development and information-technology operations which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

## Project*
Definition: used for hosting your codebase, as an issue tracker, collaborate on code, and continuously build, test, and deploy your app with built-in GitLab CI/CD.

## Issue**
Definition: the fundamental medium for collaborating on ideas and planning work in GitLab

## Milestone
Definition: are a way to track issues and merge requests created to achieve a broader goal in a certain period of time. They allow you to organize issues and merge requests into a cohesive group, with an optional start date and an optional due date.

## Label
Definition: allow you to categorize epics, issues, and merge requests using descriptive titles like bug, feature request, or docs, as well as customizable colors. They allow you to quickly and dynamically filter and manage epics, issues, and merge requests, and are a key part of issue boards.

## Weight
Definition: allow you to get a better idea of how much time, value or complexity a given issue has or will cost.

## Merge Request**
Definition: allows you to visualize and collaborate on the proposed changes to source code that exist as commits on a given Git branch. A Merge Request (MR) is the basis of GitLab as a code collaboration and version control platform. It is as simple as the name implies: a request to merge one branch into another.

## Commit
Definition: Merge requests allow you to visualize and collaborate on the proposed changes to source code that exist as commits on a given Git branch

## Branch
Definition: a version of a project’s working tree. You create a branch for each set of related changes you make. This keeps each set of changes separate from each other, allowing changes to be made in parallel, without affecting each other.

## Markdown*
Definition: a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

## Local
Definition: your machine
Example: If someone says to do something locally that means to open the terminal on your computer to make a change.

## SSH Key (SSH = Secure Shell)
Definition: a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

## Source Code*
Definition: a text listing of commands to be compiled or assembled into an executable computer program.

## Terminal
Definition: used for entering data into, and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system.

## Open Source
Definition: denoting software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.
